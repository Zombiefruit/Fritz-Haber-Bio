          <p class="lead">
            Fritz Haber received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemisty for his invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber-Bosch_process">Haber-Bosch process</a>, a novel way to synthesize
            industrial quantities of ammonia, used as both a major component in
            fertilizer and in explosives. Haber is also considered the "father of chemical
            warfare" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine
            and other poisonous gases during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War 1</a>, especially his actions during
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Half of the world's food supply depends upon the Haber-Bosch process,
            and widespread availability of fertilizer has saved billions from starvation
            over the last century. However, Haber was fanatically devoted to his chemical
            weapons, and still supported their use in war even after seeing the damage
            caused on the human body. He was truly the archetypal mad scientist.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Fritz Haber was born in Breslau, in eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia">Prussia</a>
              (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw">Wroc≈Çaw</a>, in western Poland), into a well-off Jewish family.
            The family name Haber was a common one in the area, but Fritz Haber's
            family has been traced back to a great-grandfather, Pinkus Selig Haber,
            a wool dealer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%99pno">Kempen</a>.
            An important Prussian edict of 13 March 1812 determined that Jews and their families,
            including Pinkus Haber, were "to be treated as local citizens and citizens of Prussia".
            Under such regulations, members of the Haber family were able to establish themselves in
            respected positions in business, politics, and law.
